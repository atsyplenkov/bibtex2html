   abstract = {Aeolian sediment transport on beaches is responsible for dune growth and/or recovery. Models predicting potential aeolian sediment transport rates often overpredict the amount of deposition on the foredune when applied to narrow (<100 m) beaches, pointing to supply limitations. Our goal is to better understand these limitations, especially in the long-term (>years) in order to improve predicted transport volumes and the timing of transport. Here, we used 8 years of Argus video images at Egmond aan Zee, The Netherlands, in combination with routine weather data to delineate 241 limited from 467 unlimited sand transport events to explore supply-limiting factors. Our research shows that the wind is more oriented to the west (shore normal) and is generally stronger for limited transport events. This indicates that the available fetch distance is often less than the critical fetch needed for unlimited transport. This is further confirmed by the timing of the transport events, as limited events often became unlimited during low tide when the beach was the widest and fetch potentially the longest. Our results help understanding the nature of aeolian sediment transport on narrow beaches, which will hopefully lead to better predictions of annual aeolian sediment transport rates.},

   abstract = {Temporal and spatial changes in wind speed, wind direction, and moisture content are ubiquitous across sandy coastal beaches. Often these factors interact in unknown ways to create complexity that confounds our ability to model sediment transport at any point across the beach as well as our capacity to predict sediment delivery into the adjacent foredunes. This study was designed to measure wind flow and sediment transport over a beach and foredune at Greenwich Dunes, Prince Edward Island National Park, with the express purpose of addressing these complex interactions. Detailed measurements are reported for one stormy day, October 11, 2004, during which meteorological conditions were highly variable. Wind speed ranged from 4 ms- 1 to over 20 ms- 1, wind direction was highly oblique varying between 60° and 85° from shore perpendicular, and moisture content of the sand surface ranged from a minimum of about 3% (by mass) to complete saturation depending on precipitation, tidal excursion, and storm surge that progressively inundated the beach. The data indicate that short-term variations (i.e., minutes to hours) in sediment transport across this beach arise predominantly because of short-term changes in wind speed, as is expected, but also because of variations in wind direction, precipitation intensity, and tide level. Even slight increases in wind speed are capable of driving more intense saltation events, but this relationship is mediated by other factors on this characteristically narrow beach. As the angle of wind approach becomes more oblique, the fetch distance increases and allows greater opportunity for the saltation system to evolve toward an equilibrium transport state before reaching the foredunes. Whether the theoretically-predicted maximum rate of transport is ever achieved depends on the character of the sand surface (e.g., grain size, slope, roughness, vegetation, moisture content) and on various attributes of the wind field (e.g., average wind speed, unsteadiness, approach angle, flow compression, boundary layer development). Moisture content is widely acknowledged as an important factor in controlling release of sediment from the beach surface. All other things being equal, the rate of sediment transport over a wet surface is lesser than over a dry surface. On this beach, the moisture effect has two important influences: (a) in a temporal sense, the rate of sediment transport typically decreases in association with rainfall and increases when surface drying takes place; and (b) in a spatio-temporal sense, shoreline excursions associated with nearshore processes (such as wave run-up, storm surge, and tidal excursions) have the effect of constraining the fetch geometry of the beach-i.e., narrowing the width of the beach. Because saturated sand surfaces, such as found in the swash zone, will only reluctantly yield sediments to aeolian entrainment, the available beach surface across which aeolian transport can occur becomes narrower as the sea progressively inundates the beach. Under these constrained conditions, the transport system begins to shut down unless wind angle becomes highly oblique (thereby increasing fetch distance). In this study, maximum sediment transport was usually measured on the mid-beach rather than the upper beach (i.e., closer to the foredunes). This unusual finding is likely because of internal boundary layer development across the beach, which yields a decrease in near-surface wind speed (and hence, transport capacity) in the landward direction. Although widely recognized in the fluid mechanics literature, this decrease in near-surface shear stress as a by-product of a developing boundary layer in the downwind direction has not been adequately investigated in the context of coastal aeolian geomorphology. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {This paper presents results from a study designed to explore the effects of beach surface moisture and fetch effects on the threshold of movement, intensity of sand transport by wind and mass flux. The experiment was carried out over a period of five weeks at Greenwich Dunes, Prince Edward Island, Canada in May and June 2002. Moisture content was measured with a Delta-T moisture probe over a 50 m by 25 m grid established on the beach. Measurements of wind speed and direction were made with arrays of cup anemometers and a two-dimensional sonic anemometer. Transport intensity was measured at a height of 2-4 cm above the bed using omnidirectional saltation probes which count the impact of saltating grains on a piezoelectric crystal. Anemometers and saltation probes were sampled at 1 Hz. Sand transport was measured with vertical integrating sand traps over periods of 10-20 minutes. Results show that where there is a considerable supply of dry sand the saltation system responds very rapidly (1-2 s) to fluctuations in wind speed, i.e. to wind gusts. Where sand supply from the surface is limited by moisture, mean transport rates are much lower and this reflects in both a reduction in the instantaneous transport rate and in a transport system that becomes increasingly intermittent. Threshold wind speed is significantly correlated with an increase in surface moisture content near the upwind end of the beach fetch, but the relationship is not significant at the downwind end where sediment transport is initiated primarily by saltation impact from upwind. Mass flux increases with increasing fetch length and the relationship is described best by a power function. Further work is necessary to develop a theoretical function to predict the increase in transport with fetch distance as well as the critical fetch distance.},

   abstract = {Wind-alone predictions of aeolian sand deposition on the most seaward coastal dune ridge often exceed measured deposition substantially. Surface moisture is a major factor limiting aeolian transport on sandy beaches, but existing measurement techniques cannot adequately characterize the spatial and temporal distribution of surface moisture content. Here, we present a new method for detecting surface moisture at high temporal and spatial resolution using a near-infrared terrestrial laser scanner (TLS), the RIEGL VZ-400. Because this TLS operates at a wavelength (1550 nm) near a water absorption band, TLS reflectance is an accurate parameter to measure surface moisture over its full range. Five days of intensive laser scanning were performed on a Dutch beach to illustrate the applicability of the TLS. Gravimetric surface moisture samples were used to calibrate the relation between reflectance and surface moisture. Results reveal a robust negative relation for the full range of possible surface moisture contents (0%–25%), with a correlation-coefficient squared of 0.85 and a root-mean-square error of 2.7%. This relation holds between 20 and 60 m from the TLS. Within this distance the TLS typically produces O(106–107) data points, which we averaged into surface moisture maps with a 1 × 1 m resolution. This grid size largely removes small reflectance disturbances induced by, for example, footprints or tire tracks, while retaining larger scale moisture trends.},

   abstract = {Ephemeral aeolian sand strips are commonplace on beaches. Their formation during high energy sand transport events often precedes the development of protodunes and their dynamics present interesting feedback mechanisms with surface moisture patterns. However, due to their temporary nature, little is known of their formation, mobility or the specifics of their interaction with beach surface characteristics. Similarly surface moisture has an important influence on sediment availability and transport in aeolian beach systems, yet it is difficult to quantify accurately due to its inherent variability over both short spatial and temporal scales. Whilst soil moisture probes and remote sensing imagery techniques can quantify large changes well, their resolution over mainly dry sand, close to the aeolian transport threshold is not ideal, particularly where moisture gradients close to the surface are large. In this study we employed a terrestrial laser scanner to monitor beach surface moisture variability during a three and a half hour period after a rain event and investigated relationships between bedform development, surface roughness and surface moisture. Our results demonstrate that as the beach surface dries, sand transport increases, with sediment erosion occurring at the wet/dry surface boundary, and deposition further downwind. This dynamic structure, dependent upon changing surface moisture characteristics, results in the formation of a rippled sand strip and ultimately a protodune. Our findings highlight dynamic mobility relationships and confirm the need to consider transient bedforms and surface moisture across a variety of scales when measuring aeolian transport in beach settings. The terrestrial laser scanner provides a suitable apparatus with which to accomplish this.},

   abstract = {There is an increasing awareness of the influence of surface moisture on aeolian entrainment and transport of sediment. Existing wind tunnel studies have shown the impact of a limited range of moisture contents on entrainment thresholds but similar investigations are lacking in the field. The research reported here investigated the influence of changes in surface moisture content on sand entrainment and transport on a meso-tidal beach in Anglesey, North Wales.High frequency (1 Hz) wind velocities measured with hot-wire anemometers were combined with grain impact data from a Sensit monitor and mass flux measurements from a standard sand trap. Surface and near-surface moisture contents were assessed gravimetrically from surface sand scrapes and also directly by using a ThetaProbe. Critical threshold values for entrainment were specified using a modified form of the time fraction equivalence method (Stout, J.E., Zobeck, T.M., 1996a. Establishing the threshold condition for soil movement in wind-eroding fields. Proceedings of the International Conference on Air Pollution from Agricultural Operations. MWPS C-3, Kansas City, 7-9 February 1996, pp. 65-71).Results indicate a time-dependent change in dominant control of the sand transport system from moisture to wind speed, dependent upon the moisture content of the surface sediment. This interchange between controlling parameters on both entrainment and transport was very sensitive to prevailing moisture conditions and took place over a period of minutes to hours. Under conditions experienced in the experiments presented here, the critical moisture threshold for sediment entrainment was determined to be between 4% and 6%, higher than the 1-4% specified in previous wind tunnel experiments. Furthermore, a moisture content of nearly 2% (where moisture was adhered to transported sediment) appeared to have little or no impact on the rate of sand flux. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {This study investigates the impact of beach sediment supply on dune volume evolution through data analysis and model simulations of the Kennemer dunes in the Netherlands. A cross-shore sediment transport model (the CS-model) is applied with local time-averaged longshore sediment transport gradients derived from bathymetric and topographic observations. The model is used to study the relative importance of different transport processes on dune volume evolution, assuming that aeolian transport from the beach to the dune is supply-limited. The wave-driven longshore transport gradients are found to explain a large part of the observed variation in the dune evolution within the study area. In accreting parts of the coast, dunes are growing due to sediment supply from longshore transport, whereas in eroding parts, dune growth depends on supply from artificial nourishments. Seasonal constructions on the beach and vegetation removal from the dunes partly impede dune growth along the considered stretch of coast. The model performance is satisfactory, being able to reproduce a considerable part of the large variation in the alongshore dune response observed in the study area. Overall, the results are a promising contribution to the capability of simulating decadal-scale dune evolution, which is important for long-term flood risk assessments and safe designs of nature-based solutions.},

The lidar is fixed on a 4-m structure located on a shore-backing dune in Duck, North Carolina. Each hour, the lidar collects a three-dimensional framescan of the nearshore region along with a 30-min twodimensional linescan time series oriented directly offshore, with a linescan repetition rate of approximately 7 Hz. The data are geo-referenced each hour using a rigorous co-registration process that fits 11 fixed planes to a baseline scan to account for small platform movements, and the residual errors from the fit are used to assess the accuracy of the rectification. This process decreased the mean error (defined as the magnitude of the offset in three planes) over a two-year period by 24.41 cm relative to using a fixed rectification matrix. The automated data processing algorithm then filters and grids the data to generate a dry-beach digital elevation model (DEM) from the framescan along with hourly wave runup, hydrodynamic, and morphologic statistics from the linescan time series. The lidar has collected data semi-continuously since January 2015 (with gaps occurring while the lidar was malfunctioning or being serviced), resulting in an hourly data set spanning four years as of January 2019.

Journal of Coastal Research, 35(4), 751-764. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. This study investigates grain-size sorting through longshore transport processes and how it influences dune evolution. The analysis is based on a data set of 58 sediment samples distributed alongshore over a 6.5-km-long sandy beach in Ängelholm, Sweden. Grain size differs significantly from north to south, where median grain size varies from about 0.4-0.15 mm. The long-term coastal evolution is derived from shoreline change analysis of a series of aerial photos from the 1940s until today and from longshore sediment transport rates calculated on the basis of wave data simulated by the SWAN wave model employed in the Coastal Engineering Research Center (CERC) formula. The results show an almost unidirectional longshore transport from north to south; the beach is eroding in the northern part and accreting in the southern part. The McLaren model, a grain size-based model to predict transport direction, was tested against the grain size data. The test indicated transport in the opposite direction. This result supports previous studies suggesting that the McLaren model has limited applicability for sandy beaches with a dominant longshore transport. The sediment samples were collected at the mid-beach face position in an area where sediment is supplied to the beach during accreting conditions. Sediment in the appropriate grain size to build dunes- A t this beach, 0.2-0.3 mm-was found in the parts of the beach where the dunes are growing. In the eroding parts, the sediment was coarser, suggesting that the longshore transport influences the supply of sediment for aeolian transport. The gradients in longshore transport rate were also found to affect dune morphology; the dunes were higher in the eroding and stable parts of the beach and lower in the accreting parts.},

   abstract = {Estimates of the wind shear stress exerted on Earth's surface using the fully rough form of the law-of-the-wall are a function of the aerodynamic roughness length, z0. Accurate prediction of aeolian sediment transport rates, therefore, often requires accurate estimates of z0. The value of z0 is determined by the surface roughness and the saltation intensity, both of which can be highly dynamic. Here we report field measurements of z0 values derived from velocity profiles measured over an evolving topography (i.e. sand ripples). The topography was measured by terrestrial laser scanning and the saltation intensity was measured using a disdrometer. By measuring the topographic evolution and saltation intensity simultaneously and using available formulae to estimate the topographic contribution to z0, we isolated the contribution of saltation intensity to z0 and document that this component dominates over the topographic component for all but the lowest shear velocities. Our measurements indicate that the increase in z0 during periods of saltation is approximately one to two orders of magnitude greater than the increase attributed to microtopography (i.e. evolving sand ripples). Our results also reveal differences in transport as a function of grain size. Each grain-size fraction exhibited a different dependence on shear velocity, with the saltation intensity of fine particles (diameters ranging from 0.125 to 0.25 mm) saturating and eventually decreasing at high shear velocities, which we interpret to be the result of a limitation in the supply of fine particles from the bed at high shear velocities due to bed armoring. Our findings improve knowledge of the controls on the aerodynamic roughness length and the grain-size dependence of aeolian sediment transport. The results should contribute to the development of improved sediment transport and dust emission models. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Two fortnight-long field experiments were carried out during which hydrodynamics and sediment dynamics were measured with optical and acoustic sensors, while the beach topography was surveyed with a permanent terrestrial laser scanner. Suspended sediment was generally well-mixed and currents were largest at approximately 1.5 m above the bed, which resulted in a peak in sediment transport at 1/3 of the high tide level. The mean transport direction was onshore during calm conditions (wave height <0.6 m) thanks to tidal currents and offshore during energetic conditions due to undertow. Oscillatory transport was always onshore because of wave asymmetry but it was subordinate to mean transport. The intertidal zone showed an alternation of erosion and accretion with formation of morphological features during energetic (no storm) conditionsand smoothening of the morphology during calm conditions. A good qualitative and quantitative agreement was found between the daily cross-shore suspended load and beach volume changes, especially during calm conditions.},

   abstract = {The wind transports sand from the beach to the dunes and is therefore important for dune growth and recovery after a storm. Identifying the conditions that favour aeolian sand transport is especially important for narrow beaches, where measured long-term (seasons to years) deposition volumes on the foredune are often substantially less than the potential input from the beach. One of the most visually distinct signs of aeolian transport can be seen when relatively dry sand moves over a wet beach and organises itself to form low, slipfaceless bedforms. These features are known as sand strips. Here, we investigate the presence and characteristics of sand strips and their dependence on regional wind conditions by using a multi-year data set of video images of the Argus tower at Egmond aan Zee, The Netherlands. The dataset average wavelength and migration rate of the sand strips is 12.0 m and 1.24 m/h, respectively. Little to no relation was found between these two sand-strip characteristics and the wind velocity. The presence of these bedforms does not depend on wind velocity either, provided the wind velocity exceeds ∼8 m/s. Instead, the wind direction determines if fully-developed sand strips form, as they are seen during alongshore or almost alongshore winds only. Our observations are indicative of topographic steering of the wind by the 25-m high foredune into the alongshore direction, as sand strips move alongshore even under onshore-oblique, regional winds.},

Beyond this range of moisture a distinct decrease in erodibility was manifested. Erodibility decreased rather slowly at first, then more rapidly with each successive increment of moisture added, reaching zero, on the average, at about 15-atmosphere percentage. Increasing the moisture even slightly above the 15-atmosphere percentage required a relatively great increase in wind velocity to produce movement of soil. It was shown that erodibility by wind is a function of the cohesive force of adsorbed water films surrounding the soil particles.

   abstract = {3 Coastal aeolian sediment transport is influenced by supply-limiting factors caused by sediment sorting by grain 4 size. Sorting processes can lead to coarsening of the bed surface and influence the formation of aeolian ripples. 5 However, the influence sorting processes and bedforms might have on the magnitude of the transport is not fully 6 understood. This study explores sorting processes and their influence on the magnitude and mode of aeolian 7 transport by using sediment tracers. Sand was painted in different colors according to particle size and placed 8 on a supratidal beach in Noordwijk, the Netherlands. Several experiments were conducted with varying wind 9 speeds. Surface sampling and cameras tracked the sand color movement on the bed surface, and wind velocity 10 was measured. The tracer experiments showed that ripples developed in moderate wind conditions. Once the 11 ripples had formed, the supply of finer tracer grains in the downwind direction decreased over time, while the 12 supply of coarser grains remained constant. A linear relationship between ripple migration speed and wind speed 13 was found. For higher wind speeds, no ripples or differences in transport of grain size fractions were observed. 14 Instead, alternating phases of erosion and deposition of the bed surface were observed, which could not be related 15 to local variations in wind velocity. Based on these results and literature, a conceptual model was developed for 16 an Active Bed Surface Layer (ABSL) with two transport regimes corresponding to moderate (I) and high (II) 17 wind speeds. The conceptual model is intended to guide the selection of aeolian sediment transport models as 18 a function of wind speed, bed characteristics, and upwind sediment supply. For Regime I, transport could be 19 modelled using a linear relationship between sediment transport and wind speed and for Regime II using a third 20 power relationship in combination with a process-based model accounting for supply limitations. 21},

   abstract = {Decimeter-scale early-stage aeolian bedforms represent topographic features that differ notably from their mature dune counterparts, with nascent forms exhibiting more gently sloping lee sides and a reverse asymmetry in their flow-parallel bed profile compared to mature dunes. Flow associated with the development of these “protodunes,” wherein the crest gradually shifts downstream towards its mature state, was investigated by studying the perturbation of the turbulent boundary layer over a succession of representative bedforms. Rigid, three-dimensional models were studied in a refractive-index-matched experimental flume that enabled near-surface quantification of mean velocities and Reynolds stresses using particle-image velocimetry in wall-normal and wall-parallel measurement planes. Data indicate strong, topographically induced flow perturbations over the protodunes, to a similar relative degree to that found over mature dunes, despite their low-angled slopes. The shape of the crest is found to be an important factor in the development of flow perturbations, and only in the case with the flattest crest was maximal speed-up of flow, and reduction in turbulent stresses, found to occur upstream of the crest. Investigation of the log-linearity of the boundary layer profile over the stoss sides showed that, although the profile is strongly perturbed, a log-linear region exists, but is shifted vertically. A streamwise trend in friction velocity is thus present, showing a behavior similar to the trends in mean velocity. Analysis of the growth of the internal boundary layer on the dune stoss sides, beginning at the toe region, reveals a similar development for all dune shapes, despite clear differences in mean velocity and turbulent stress perturbations in their toe regions. The data presented herein provide the first documentation of flow over morphologies broadly characteristic of subtle, low-angle, aeolian protodunes, and indicate key areas where further study is required to yield a more complete quantitative understanding of flow–form–transport couplings that govern their morphodynamics.},

   abstract = {Early-stage aeolian bedforms, or protodunes, are elemental in the continuum of dune development and act as essential precursors to mature dunes. Despite this, we know very little about the processes and feedback mechanisms that shape these nascent bedforms. Whilst theory and conceptual models have offered some explanation for protodune existence and development, until now, we have lacked the technical capability to measure such small bedforms in aeolian settings. Here, we employ terrestrial laser scanning to measure morphological change at the high frequency and spatial resolution required to gain new insights into protodune behaviour. On a 0.06 m high protodune, we observe vertical growth of the crest by 0.005 m in two hours. Our direct measurements of sand transport on the protodune account for such growth, with a reduction in time-averaged sediment flux of 18% observed over the crestal region. Detailed measurements of form also establish key points of morphological change on the protodune. The position on the stoss slope where erosion switches to deposition is found at a point 0.07 m upwind of the crest. This finding supports recent models that explain vertical dune growth through an upwind shift of this switching point. Observations also show characteristic changes in the asymmetric cross-section of the protodune. Flow-form feedbacks result in a steepening of the lee slope and a decline in lower stoss slope steepness (by 3°), constituting a reshaping of protodune form towards more mature dune morphology. The approaches and findings applied here, (a) demonstrate an ability to quantify processes at requisite spatial and temporal scales for monitoring early-stage dune evolution, (b) highlight the crucial role of form-flow feedbacks in enabling early-stage bedform growth, alluding to a fluctuation in feedbacks that require better representation in dune models, and (c) provide a new stimulus for advancing understanding of aeolian bedforms.

   abstract = {One explanation for bedform patterns is self-organization in which the pattern emerges because of interactions among the bedforms themselves. Models, remote images, field studies and lab experiments have identified bedform interactions that involve whole bedforms, only bedform defects, or that are remote interactions between bedforms. It is proposed that bedform interactions form a spectrum from constructive to regenerative in pattern development. Constructive interactions, including merging, lateral linking, cannibalization, and remote transfer of sediment, push the system toward fewer, larger, more widely spaced bedforms. Regenerative interactions, including bedform splitting, defect creation and calving, push the system back toward a more initial state. Other interactions, including off-center collision, defect migration, and bedform and defect repulsion, cause pattern change, but may not be strongly constructive or regenerative. Although bedform interactions are ubiquitous to any field of bedforms, their dynamics, flow-field modification, and impact upon measurable pattern parameters are yet poorly understood. Most bedform interactions span bedform types and fluids, supporting the hypothesis that pattern emerges from dynamics at the bedform level in a hierarchy that includes lower levels of bedform-flow and grain-fluid interactions. Bedform interactions alone, however, cannot account for the rich diversity of bedform patterns in nature. It is proposed that field diversity arises because of boundary conditions, which are the environmental variables within which a field evolves. Conceptually, boundary conditions modify the shape of the attractor toward which a field evolves, possibly by altering the type and frequency of bedform interactions. Boundary conditions are broadly similar within system types, but are unique for each bedform field so that no two are ever exactly alike. Although aeolian and fluvial systems share some types of boundary conditions, flow depth is a unique boundary condition in shallow fluvial systems. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

The model is based on the modification of the well-known Bagnold equation by including the threshold shear velocity, which is also slightly modified to ensure a smoother transition from the non-transport regime to the transport regime. The sand transport rate is related to the static and dynamic grain roughness by using a semi-empirical roughness predictor, which is calibrated based on sand transport data from wind tunnel experiments with a flat mobile sand surface. The model input for dry sand is the wind velocity at one height above the surface and the sand characteristics (d50, d90). The effects of moisture, vegetation and shells on the sand transport process are included by fairly simple expressions which are acting on the shear velocity, the threshold value and the transport rate. In all, 105 high-quality data sets have been used for verification of the proposed predictive model. About 72% of the predicted values are within a factor of 2 of measured values of the transport rate.},

   abstract = {In sandy beach systems, the aeolian sediment transport can be governed by the vertical structure of the sediment layers at the bed surface. Here, data collected with a newly developed sand scraper is presented to determine high-resolution vertical grain size variability and how it is affected by marine and aeolian processes. Sediment samples at up to 2 mm vertical resolution down to 50 mm depth were collected at three beaches: Waldport (Oregon, USA), Noordwijk (the Netherlands) and Duck (North Carolina, USA). The results revealed that the grain size in individual layers can differ considerably from the median grain size of the total sample. The most distinct temporal variability occurred due to marine processes that resulted in significant morphological changes in the intertidal zone. The marine processes during high water resulted both in fining and coarsening of the surface sediment. Especially near the upper limit of wave runup, the formation of a veneer of coarse sediment was observed. Although the expected coarsening of the near-surface grain size during aeolian transport events was observed at times, the opposite trend also occurred. The latter could be explained by the formation and propagation of aeolian bedforms within the intertidal zone locally resulting in sediment fining at the bed surface. The presented data lays the basis for future sediment sampling strategies and sediment transport models that investigate the feedbacks between marine and aeolian transport, and the vertical variability of the grain size distribution.},

   abstract = {In sandy environments, like the beach-dune system, buildings not only affect the airflow, but also the aeolian sediment transport in their surroundings. In this study, we determine how the horizontal size of sediment deposition patterns around buildings depends on the building's dimensions. Four one-day experiments were conducted at the beach using box-shaped scale models. We tested 32 building geometries, where scale model height, width and length ranged between 0.3 and 2.0 m. The deposition patterns were substantial in size: the total length and width of the deposition area were up to an order of magnitude larger than the horizontal building dimensions. It was found that the size of upwind and downwind deposition patterns depended more on the building width perpendicular to the wind direction (w), than on the building height (h). Building length had little influence. Especially the combined effect of w and h correlated well with horizontal deposition size. This is expressed in a new scaling length B for deposition around buildings, with B=w2/3·h1/3. As a first validation, the spatial dimensions of the initial deposition patterns observed around a scale model of 2.5 × 12 × 2.5 m, placed at the beach for five weeks, showed good agreement with those predicted based on B.},

In this study, we present a methodology for the detection of anthropogenic changes in a coastal ecosystem by automatically detecting active bulldozers in continuous beach video data. PCA is used to highlight changes in consecutive images due to moving objects. Next, the YOLO object detection algorithm is used to identify the bulldozers in the change images. YOLO was specifically trained for the task, obtaining a precision of 0.94 and a recall of 0.81. An automatic tool was developed, and the process was carried out on two months of video data, consisting of approximately 19 000 images. The resulting information was compared with changes derived from 3D data obtained from a permanent laser scanner. The correlation among the results of the two methodologies was computed. For a validation area and daily time frame a correlation of 0.88 was obtained between the number of detected bulldozers and the area affected by changes in height larger than 0.3 m.},

   abstract = {Sandy coasts are constantly changing environments governed by complex, interacting processes. Permanent laser scanning is a promising technique to monitor such coastal areas and to support analysis of geomorphological deformation processes. This novel technique delivers 3-D representations of the coast at hourly temporal and centimetre spatial resolution and allows us to observe small-scale changes in elevation over extended periods of time. These observations have the potential to improve understanding and modelling of coastal deformation processes. However, to be of use to coastal researchers and coastal management, an efficient way to find and extract deformation processes from the large spatiotemporal data set is needed. To enable automated data mining, we extract time series of surface elevation and use unsupervised learning algorithms to derive a partitioning of the observed area according to change patterns. We compare three well-known clustering algorithms (k-means clustering, agglomerative clustering and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise; DBSCAN), apply them on the set of time series and identify areas that undergo similar evolution during 1 month.We test if these algorithms fulfil our criteria for suitable clustering on our exemplary data set. The three clustering methods are applied to time series over 30 d extracted from a data set of daily scans covering about 2 km of coast in Kijkduin, the Netherlands. A small section of the beach, where a pile of sand was accumulated by a bulldozer, is used to evaluate the performance of the algorithms against a ground truth. The k-means algorithm and agglomerative clustering deliver similar clusters, and both allow us to identify a fixed number of dominant deformation processes in sandy coastal areas, such as sand accumulation by a bulldozer or erosion in the intertidal area. The level of detail found with these algorithms depends on the choice of the number of clusters k. The DBSCAN algorithm finds clusters for only about 44% of the area and turns out to be more suitable for the detection of outliers, caused, for example, by temporary objects on the beach. Our study provides a methodology to efficiently mine a spatiotemporal data set for predominant deformation patterns with the associated regions where they occur.},

During a scan experiment in February/March 2020 point clouds were acquired every thirty minutes with a Riegl VZ-2000 laser scanner, and various other sensors (inclination sensors, weather station and GNSS sensors) were used to survey the environment of the laser scanner and the study site. Using this measurement configuration, our aim is to identify apparent displacements in multioral scans due to systematic error influences and to investigate data quality for assessment of geomorphic changes in coastal regions. We analyse scan data collected around two storm events around 09/02/2020 (Ciara) and around 22/02/2020 (Yulia) and derive the impact of heavy storms on the point cloud data through comparison with the collected auxiliary data. To investigate the systematic residuals on data acquired by permanent laser scanning, we extracted several stable flat surfaces from the point cloud data. From a plane fitted through the respective surfaces of each scan, we estimated the mean displacement of each plane with the respective root mean square errors. Inclination sensors, internal and external, recorded pitch and roll values during each scan. We derived a mean inclination per scan (in pitch and roll) and the standard deviation from the mean as a measure of the stability of the laser scanner during each scan. Evaluation of the data recorded by a weather station together with knowledge of the movement behaviour, allows to derive possible causes of displacements and/or noise and correction models. The results are compared to independent measurements from GNSS sensors for validation. For wind speeds of 10m/s and higher, movements of the scanner considerably increase the noise level in the point cloud data.},

The moisture content of a thin surface layer (≈2 mm thickness) is computed as a function of wave runup, precipitation, evaporation, percolation, and capillary rise from the groundwater table. The groundwater table is simulated using a modified Boussinesq equation accounting for the overheight due to wave runup. The surface moisture due to capillary rise is simulated with an experimentally determined soil water retention (SWR) curve of the "van Genuchten" type. Hysteresis is accounted for by differentiating between SWR curves for drying and wetting conditions. The model is tested against a data set of 221 point observations of surface moisture from Noordwijk beach in the Netherlands. The measured surface moisture within the study area displays large spatial and temporal variability. The model results display an expected cross-shore gradient of moisture content, but also a large scatter when compared to the data. The scatter may partly be explained by local variability of hydraulic properties that are not accounted for within the model. Despite the scatter, the proposed surface moisture model is a starting point to integrate the transport limiting effect of surface moisture into meso-scale aeolian transport models. To facilitate model setup and the use of this surface moisture model, the soil water retention data from 10 beaches with variable grain size characteristics are provided in this study. Future studies may focus on additional model validation against data sets with variable meteorological conditions and simultaneous moisture and aeolian transport observations.},

The seafloor was continuously covered by dynamic bedforms with amplitudes ranging 0.02-0.40 m and wavelengths ranging 0.20-2.5 m. Ripple migration rates were up to 3.6 m/h, dependent on the energy of the waves and currents. Under the assumption of bedload dominant transport, cross-shore and alongshore sediment volume flux by ripples was estimated from observations at the spatially separated imaging locations. The average and maximum ripple sediment volume flux was found to be 0.22 and 1.7 m 3 /m/day, respectively, with larger fluxes during spring flood tides and storm wave conditions. The daily averaged fluxes were usually oriented about 30 • north of shore-normal, moving in the same direction as a nearby transverse sandbar migration direction. Estimated gradients in the sediment flux within the surfzone were computed from bed level change measurements of the inner surfzone including a larger scale transverse sandbar measured from subsequent jetski surveys. We find that the estimated gradients in surfzone sediment flux are conceivably driven by small variations in the sediment flux driven by sand ripple migration, supported by our observations of ripple driven sediment flux at the two ripple imaging stations. A simple conceptual model is presented that shows how small scale bedforms may contribute to the growth and decay of larger scale bathymetric features, such as sandbars. Results suggest that sediment flux by small scale sand ripples and megaripples could significantly contribute to larger scale morphologic development in the surfzone.},

Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. The superposition of smaller bedforms on larger dunes have been observed in multiple energetic tidal environments. This study analyzes the interaction of two scales of superimposed bedforms at Wasque Shoals, an ebb delta located approximately 1 km SE of Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. Data from a fixed rotary sidescan sonar deployed on a submerged quadpod captured the interaction of megaripples, or bedforms with wavelengths on the order of 1 m, with the lee side of a migrating dune with a wavelength of approximately 100 m. The net convergence of megaripples on the tidally dominant lee face of the dune suggests that the megaripples serve as an intermediate step between grain-scale transport processes and the large-scale dune migration. This conceptual model is quantitatively tested given observations of seabed elevation changes and dune migration rates. With this novel data set, two scales of bedforms were resolved on subtidal timescales, facilitating new insights into the dynamics of superimposed bedforms in tidal environments.},

   abstract = {AaSTRAC'r: Portions of the back-island dune fields on Padre Island, Texas, undergo seasonal destructive and constructive phases in which they are reduced to a nearly planar surface during the winter and then reform during the spring and summer. Initial depositional sites for dry sand that we observed were associated with roughness elements that caused a lowering of the transport capacity of the flow. Bedforms develop through a series of morphologic and dynamic stages: I) irregular patches of dry sand, 2) wind-ripple protodunes with leeward flow expansion, 3) grainfall protodunes with a range from leeward flow expansion to flow separation, 4) barchan dunes with grainflow, and 5) crescentic ridges that characterize the mature field. The survival and further development of protodunes and dunes is favored by increased size, a more advanced stage of development, unidirectional and moderate wind, and a plentiful sand supply. These factors can be viewed as the result of the interrelationship of aspects of eolian transport, the nature of leeward secondary airflow patterns, and sand supply. Dune-field ordering occurs by repeated merging, splitting, cannibalization, and lateral linking of dunes. On Padre Island and other areas of dunes that we studied, flow conditions across portions of interdune flats favor the transport of dry, loose sand from interdune flats onto the dunes, so that dunes grow at the expense of interdune flats. Dry-surface deposits are, therefore, unlikely to accumulate on interdune flats, but rather to characterize interdune depressions that may represent the minimum distance to which an interdune flat can be closed. Otherwise, accumulations on interdune flats most commonly should be formed on wet or damp surfaces or occur associated with some mechanism that protects the deposits from deflation. Padre Island dune fields represent a type of eolian system where accumulations of dunes and interdune flats occur during periods of a water-table rise, with bypassing and deflation occurring as the water table becomes static or fails, respectively.},

   abstract = {Optical remote sensing provides a low cost method of documenting surface conditions over extended periods of time. Its utility in resolving large scale aeolian transport events is examined in this paper. To this end, over 1800 images taken over a three month period by a stationary camera in a coastal setting are classified as containing/ not containing aeolian transport using both a manual and automated approach. In both cases transport is inferred by the identification of aeolian streamers within a given image. With regards to the manual approach, images were visually examined by three users. There was good agreement between the different users with 77.8% of transport identifications being unanimous. Comparison of the user results with measured transport highlights that observations of transport in images coincide with increased particle counts. The particle counts indicate that transport is dominated by a series of discernible transport events. Transport is observed in images throughout the duration of these events. Manually processing the images is a laborious process. A method is presented which allows for the automated detection of images containing transport. The method utilises 2D-DFTs to exploit the linear appearance of streamers in images. Relative to the manual classifications which serve as ground truth, the method performs well in identifying images containing transport with values of precision, recall and F1 score ⩾0.85.},

   abstract = {High-frequency measurements of airflow from ultrasonic anemometers and time-averaged cup anemometer profiles were taken during an oblique alongshore sand-transporting event (6.7 m/s) over a vegetated foredune in May 2002 as part of a larger study on the sedimentary dynamics of a beach-dune complex in Greenwich Dunes, Prince Edward Island National Park, Canada. Local flow and sand transport pathways deviated significantly from the regional wind because of topographic steering of oblique alongshore airflow on the beach back toward the foredune in the backshore. Flow decelerated on the lower seaward slope of the foredune because of flow stagnation and vegetation-induced roughness effects. On the upper seaward slope, flow veered crest-parallel because of secondary flow effects, including potential flow reversal, acceleration, and interaction with faster regional flow. An inflection point in velocity profiles indicates a momentum sink at plant canopy height, and above this height exists a distinct shear layer. Flow acceleration occurs only on the upper slope above the plant canopy as the shear layer intensifies. Flow steadiness, as indicated by the coefficient of variation in horizontal (U) and vertical (W) velocity, also declines up the seaward slope, in contrast to measurements of flow over unvegetated dunes, perhaps because of increasing vegetation-induced drag and turbulence. Gusting and vertical bursting was evident as honami motion in the beachgrass and was responsible for maintaining intermittent saltation into the foredune. Temporal correlations exist between U, W, and flow angle. As flow shifted onshore, both U and W increased because of enhanced topographic forcing and increased vertical lift on the lower seaward slope, whereas when flow shifted alongshore, U and W declined because of reduced forcing and acceleration effects because the dune is effectively less steep to flow. Although these dunes align well with the vector of the regional resultant sediment drift potential, sand transport pathways followed local flow vectors of varying magnitude and direction. Offshore to oblique alongshore winds are typical of the summer wind regime, and, although frequently incompetent, they contribute to dune maintenance by cycling sand to the backshore for incipient foredune growth, scarp infilling, or both. To date, the role of secondary flows under alongshore winds in foredune morphodynamics has not been well documented.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive study of wave refraction, wave and wind driven sediment transport, foredune development and Holocene barrier evolution over a variety of time scales at Moçambique Beach, Santa Catarina State, Southern Brazil. The motivation for this study was to examine the relationships between estimated wave driven sediment transport, medium and long term aeolian transport, foredune development, and Holocene barrier volumes and morphology. An analysis of 2. years of wave rider data for the region shows two well defined peaks of frequencies: one of swell waves from the south with a period of 12. s, and another peak of sea waves from east-northeast with a period of 7. s. Longshore sediment transport rates were calculated using high resolution hindcast wave data for the South Atlantic Ocean, which was calibrated by the measured buoy data. The dominant southerly waves drive a longshore gradient in wave energy from south to north, and nearshore/surf zone sediment transport increases from south to north. Beach grain size is fine in both the south and north, and medium in the center. The combination of grain size and wave energy variations creates a marked alongshore variation in surf zone beach types ranging from low energy dissipative in the south, moderate energy intermediate in the central area to moderate to high energy dissipative in the north. Estimates of aeolian sediment transport, volumetric changes in foredune deposition and total Holocene dunefield volumes were also calculated. Results indicate that the morphological behavior of the foredune profiles reflects the gradients of longshore sediment transport and the exposure to wind energy and aeolian sediment delivery, with a maximum of sediment volume and transport towards, and in the central part and northern end of the barrier. Holocene (0-7000. years) barrier volumes vary along the embayment, mimicking the trends in both calculated wave and wind driven sediment transport. The Short and Hesp (1982) model was more suitable in predicting the long term (Holocene) barrier evolution than the size and volume of the foredune. The combination of wide beach, high energy dissipation, maximum sediment supply, and high exposure to strong onshore winds is found in the northern end of the embayment where Holocene subaerial barrier volumes are at a maximum. Overall, this study proves that foredune development is closely related to wind exposure, wave energy and gradients of longshore sediment transport, and that dunefield development reflects the increase downdrift in potential sediment supply from the southern to the northern end of the beach, and the change alongshore from low energy dissipative, through intermediate, to high energy dissipative beach-surf zone environments. This paper significantly extends previous models of beach and dune interactions in that it (i) actually determines wave driven sediment transport for various sections of a long embayment, (ii) relates those transport patterns to surf zone/beach morphodynamic types and variations in alongshore sediment patterns, and (iii) correlates foredune volumes and Holocene barrier volumes (which reflect proxy Holocene onshore transport rates) with wave driven sediment transport rates. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Here we show field evidence of a mechanism to explain the initiation of sand patches on non-erodible surfaces, such as desert gravels and moist beaches. Changes in sand transport dynamics, directly associated with the height of the saltation layer and variable transport law, observed at the boundary between non-erodible and erodible surfaces lead to sand deposition on the erodible surface. This explains how sand patches can form on surfaces with limited sand availability where linear stability of dune theory does not apply. This new mechanism is supported by field observations that evidence both the change in transport rate over different surfaces and in situ patch formation that leads to modification of transport dynamics at the surface boundary.},

A combination of human and natural forcing results in morphologic changes affecting both nature values and coastal safety. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) is a technique enabling near-continuous monitoring of the changing morphology of a sandy beach-dune system with centimetre-order accuracy. In Kijkduin, The Netherlands, a laser scanner sampled one kilometre of coast at hourly intervals for about six months. This resulted in over 4,000 consecutive topographic scans of around one million points each, at decimetre-order point spacing. Analysis of the resulting dataset will offer new insights into the morphological behaviour of the beach-dune system at hourly to monthly time scales, ultimately increasing our fundamental scientific understanding of these complex geographic systems. It further provides the basis for developing novel algorithms to extract morphodynamic and geodetic information from this unique 4D spatiotemporal dataset. Finally, experiences from this TLS setup support the development of improved near-continuous 3D observation of both natural and anthropogenic scenes in general.},

   abstract = {A large, low pressure Nor'easter storm and Hurricane Joaquin contributed to multiple weeks of sustained, elevated wave and water level conditions along the southeastern Atlantic coast of the United States in Fall 2015. Sea level anomalies in excess of 1 m and offshore wave heights of up to 4 m were recorded during these storms, as observed at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Field Research Facility in Duck, NC, USA. In response to these energetic oceanographic conditions, there were highly variable morphologic changes to the dune over short spatial scales (<km) which included a range of responses from vertical dune scarping to no measureable response. The portion of the study area with the largest dune erosion occurred at a location fronted by an abnormally deep nearshore bathymetric feature, which altered surf-zone waves and hydrodynamics. The pre-storm beach and dune topography also varied throughout the study area, additionally influencing the frequency of dune collision and contributing to the spatially variable erosion patterns. This work uses field datasets and numerical modeling tools to investigate the causation of hotspot dune erosion at the Field Research Facility. Three different numerical models were tested against the available data in order to assess model skill at resolving complex spatial dune erosion patterns. The three models successfully reproduce the general spatial trends in alongshore variable responses, although not necessarily the details of profile response or net erosion magnitude. Analysis of the model outputs, in conjunction with the available field data, suggests that the observed hotspot dune erosion is related to a complex combination of both topographic and bathymetric controls on the processes driving dune erosion. Therefore, the most simplistic model tested, which only accounts for alongshore variations in topographic profile details, can only predict hotspot dune erosion in locations where steep beach and/or dune topography is the primary control on collisional dune impacts. The higher fidelity models, which account for feedback effects from subaqueous morphology, are similarly able to predict the locations of maximum hotspot erosion, but are sensitive to beach over-steepening and/or errors in wave runup calculations that can lead to over-prediction of simulated dune erosion. This work highlights that numerous existing tools are capable of identifying the foredune regions at most risk from hotspot erosion, as well as the need for continued research to improve representation of all relevant intra-storm morphodynamic processes.},

To investigate and quantify the cross-shore morphologic behavior of intertidal bars, hourly terrestrial laser scans of Kijkduin beach (The Netherlands) are used and a conceptual evolution intertidal bar model is constructed. In a six-week period in January and February 2017, a pronounced intertidal bar formed at Kijkduin beach and migrated onshore during mild wave conditions and eroded again during storm conditions. The observed maximum shoreward migration was 30 m horizontally with a maximum growth of about 1 m in the vertical direction. Onshore sediment transport fluxes peaked around 2 m 3 per m width per day. In the conceptual model proposed here, run-up and overwash processes are dominant for shoreward growth and migration of the bar and submersion processes are responsible for bar destruction.},

An algorithm was developed to classify foredune state from 50-cm bare earth DEMs into four categories: scarped, recovering, healthy, and man-made. The algorithm was based on extraction of morphological features including the slope, volume, and curvature of the foredune face. Preliminary results detailing the response of each foredune state to a 4-day Nor'Easter (Hs = 4.8m at 16s in 8m of water) are presented, and suggest that man-made and recovering dunes lost more volume and eroded more rapidly when compared with scarped dunes. The increased erosion may have been due to a combination of slightly lower dune-toe elevations for the man-made dunes and unconsolidated sediment in the foredune.},

Permanent Laser Scanning (PLS) is a successful technique to not only observe notably sandy coasts incidentally or once every year, but (nearly) continuously over extended periods of time. The collected point cloud observations form a 4D point cloud data set representing the evolution of the coast provide the opportunity to assess change processes at high level of detail. For an exemplary location in Noordwijk, The Netherlands, three years of hourly point clouds were acquired on a 1 km long section of a typical Dutch urban sandy beach. Often, the so-called level of detection is used to assess point cloud differences from two epochs. To explicitly incorporate the temporal dimension of the height estimates from the point cloud data set, we revisit statistical testing theory. We apply multiple hypothesis testing on elevation time series in order to identify different coastal processes, like aeolian sand transport or bulldozer works. We then estimate the minimal detectable bias for different alternative hypotheses, to quantify the minimal elevation change that can be estimated from the PLS observations over a certain period of time. Additionally, we analyse potential error sources and influences on the elevation estimations and provide orders of magnitudes and possible ways to deal with them. Finally we conclude that elevation time series from a long term PLS data set are a suitable input to identify aeolian sand transport with the help of multiple hypothesis testing. In our example case, slopes of 0.032 m/day and sudden changes of 0.031 m can be identified with statistical power of 80% and with 95% significance in 24-h time series on the upper beach. In the intertidal area the presented method allows to classify daily elevation time series over one month according to the dominating model (sudden change or linear trend) in either eroding or accreting behaviour.},

   abstract = {Geographic observation benefits from the increasing availability of time series of 3D geospatial data, which allow analysis of change processes at high temporal detail and over extensive periods. In this context, the demand for advanced methods to detect and extract topographic surface changes from these 4D geospatial data emerges. Changes in natural scenes occur with varying magnitude, duration, spatial extent, and change rate, and the timing of their occurrence is not known. Standard pairwise change detection requires the selection of fixed analysis periods and the specification of magnitude thresholds to determine accumulation or erosion forms. In settings with continuous surface morphology and dynamic changes to the surface due to material transport, such change forms are typically temporary and may be missed or aggregated if they occur with spatial and/or temporal overlap. This is overcome with the extraction of 4D objects-by-change (4D-OBCs). These objects are obtained by firstly detecting surface changes in the temporal domain at locations in the scene. Subsequently, they are spatially delineated by considering the full history of surface change during region growing from the seed location of a detected change. To perform this spatiotemporal segmentation systematically for entire 3D time series, we develop a fully automatic approach of seed detection and selection, combined with locally adaptive thresholding for region growing of individual objects with varying change properties. We apply our workflow to a five-months hourly time series of around 3,000 terrestrial laser scanning point clouds acquired for coastal monitoring at a sandy beach in The Netherlands. This provides 2,021 4D-OBCs as extracted accumulation or erosion forms. Results are validated through majority agreement of six expert analysts, who evaluate the segmentation performance at sample locations throughout the scene. Accordingly, our method extracts surface changes with an error of omission of 4.7% and an error of commission of 16.6%. We examine the results and provide considerations how postprocessing of segments can further improve the change analysis workflow. The developed approach thereby provides a powerful tool for automatic change analysis in 4D geospatial data, namely to detect and delineate natural surface changes across space and time.},

   abstract = {The landscape seen by the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) Opportunity at Meridiani Planum is dominated by eolian (wind-blown) ripples with concentrated surface lags of hematitic spherules and fragments. These ripples exhibit profound spatial grain size sorting, with well-sorted coarse-grained crests and poorly sorted, generally finer-grained troughs. These ripples were the most common bed form encountered by Opportunity in its traverse from Eagle Crater to Endurance Crater. Field measurements from White Sands National Monument, New Mexico, show that such coarse-grained ripples form by the different transport modes of coarse- and fine-grain fractions. On the basis of our field study, and simple theoretical and experimental considerations, we show how surface deposits of coarse-grained ripples can be used to place tight constraints on formative wind conditions on planetary surfaces. Activation of Meridiani Planum coarse-grained ripples requires a wind velocity of 70 m/s (at a reference elevation of 1 m above the bed). From images by the Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) of reversing dust streaks, we estimate that modern surface winds reach a velocity of at least 40 m/s and hence may occasionally activate these ripples. The presence of hematite at Meridiani Planum is ultimately related to formation of concretions during aqueous diagenesis in groundwater environments; however, the eolian concentration of these durable particles may have led to the recognition from orbit of this environmentally significant landing site.

Based on a three-year hindcast of a bar cycle at Noordwijk (Netherlands) and on additional synthetic runs using a wave-averaged cross-shore process model, this study identifies the dominant mechanisms that govern the bar amplitude growth and decay during net interannual offshore migration. The bar amplitude response is particularly sensitive to the water depth above the bar crest, h Xb, and the angle of wave incidence, θ. These variables largely control the amount of waves breaking on the bar and the strength and cross-shore distribution of the associated longshore current. The longshore current has its maximum landward of the bar crest, inducing additional stirring of sediment on the landward bar slope and trough. The enhanced sediment concentration in the trough region shifts the cross-shore transports peak landward of the bar crest forcing bar amplitude growth during offshore migration. For increased h Xb-values wave breaking becomes less frequent, consequently reducing the influence of the longshore current on sediment stirring. Therefore, the resulting dominance of the cross-shore current results in a sediment transport peak at the bar crest causing bar amplitude decay. All four types of bar response (viz. all combinations of onshore/offshore migration and bar amplitude growth/decay) can occur for a single wave height and wave period combination, depending on h Xb and θ. Additional hindcast runs in which the wave direction was assumed time-invariant confirmed that h Xb and θ largely control the transient bar amplitude response. © 2011 Elsevier B.V..},

   abstract = {In this study, an intertidal bar and trough system on the beach of Noordwijk, The Netherlands was monitored over a 15-month period in order to examine the daily to seasonal sequential cross-shore behaviour and to establish which conditions force or interrupt this cyclic bar behaviour. The beach morphology (bars and troughs) was classified from low-tide ARGUS video images based on surface composition. From the classified images, time series of the landward boundary of the bar and of the trough were extracted. The time series of the alongshore-averaged boundary positions described sawtooth motion with a period between 1 and 4 months, comprising gradual landward migration followed by abrupt seaward shifts. The abrupt seaward shift appeared to be a morphological reset induced by storm events, which lasted at least 30 h with a large average root-mean-square wave height (≥2 m) and offshore surge level (≥0.5 m), and a small trough (<20 m wide) in the pre-storm beach morphology. The time series of the boundary positions exhibited very little longer (seasonal) scale variability, but somewhat larger smaller (daily) scale variability. The bar boundary was found to be more dynamic than the trough boundary. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

   abstract = {The understanding and prediction of coastal behaviour over a time span of decades and alongshore stretches of tens of kilometres is important in coastal management. The controlling variables for coastal behaviour on these scales are yet unknown. It is hypothesised that regions exhibiting different large-scale coastal behaviour (LSCB-regions) are controlled by different hydrodynamic forcings, or by different sedimentological or morphological constraints, or by some combination of these factors. The objective of this study is to elaborate a method that effectively quantifies large-scale morphological changes from a large bathymetric data set (large temporal and spatial extent combined with a high resolution), such to define LSCB-regions. The method of analysis consists of a combination of the empirical eigenfunction technique and a moving window approach. The method has been applied on a data set of over 14,000 nearshore profiles. The data set consists of yearly soundings of the nearshore profile along a coastal stretch of 115 km length (the Holland coast). The alongshore profile spacing is generally 250 m. All profiles surveyed in the period 1963-1990 are included in the analysis. Application of the method on the Dutch data set reveals that LSCB-regions indeed can be identified. The sizes of the LSCB-regions are 5 km, 15 km, 20 km, 32 km, and 42 km. Differences in behaviour of the 'secondary' morphology (i.e. morphology other than the mean profile shape, e.g. nearshore bars) are most pronounced. The change in behaviour between LSCB-regions generally occurs over distances as short as about 2 km. The boundaries between the regions are therefore surprisingly sharp. In general, no clear long-term trends in the development of the shape of the sub-aqueous profile have been observed along the Holland coast. Along certain stretches, trends in cross-shore shifting of the sub-aqueous profile occurred. The average shape of the sub-aqueous profile seems to have no relation with the trend in cross-shore shifting of the shoreline (the +1 m-contour). The (sub)decadal shoreline fluctuations, however, are possibly related to the largescale dynamics of multiple bar systems. © 1995.},

A field campaign was setup at Kijkduin, The Netherlands to monitor a kilometre of beach for up to 6 months.

   abstract = {Anthropogenic activities and climate change in coastal areas require continuous monitoring for a better understanding of environmental evolution and for the implementation of protection strategies. Surface moisture is one of the important drivers of coastal variability because it highly affects shoreward sand transport via aeolian processes. Several methods have been explored for measuring surface moisture at different spatiotemporal resolutions, and in recent years, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology has been investigated as a remote sensing tool for high-spatiotemporal-resolution moisture detection. The aim of the present study is the assessment of the performance of a permanent terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) with an original setting located on a high position and hourly scanning of a wide beach area stretching from a swash zone to the base of a dune in order to evaluate the soil moisture at a high spatiotemporal resolution. The reflectance of a Riegl-VZ2000 located in Noordwijk on the Dutch coast was used to assess a new calibration curve that allows the estimation of soil moisture. Three days of surveys were conducted to collect ground-truth soil moisture measurements with a time-domain reflectometry (TDR) sensor at 4 cm depth. Each in situ measurement was matched with the closest reflectance measurement provided by the TLS; the data were interpolated using a non-linear least squares method. A calibration curve that allowed the estimation of the soil moisture in the range of 0-30% was assessed; it presented a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 4.3% and a coefficient of determination (R-square) of 0.86. As an innovative aspect, the calibration curve was tested under different circumstances, including weather conditions and tidal levels. Moreover, the TDR data collected during an independent survey were used to validate the assessed curve. The results show that the permanent TLS is a highly suitable technique for accurately evaluating the surface moisture variations on a wide sandy beach area with a high spatiotemporal resolution.},

   abstract = {A terrestrial laser scanner measures the distance to an object surface with a precision in the order of millimeters. The quality of the individual points in a point cloud, although directly affecting standard processing steps like point cloud registration and segmentation, is still not well understood. The quality of a scan point is influenced by four major factors: instrument mechanism, atmospheric conditions, object surface properties and scan geometry. In this paper, the influence of the scan geometry on the individual point precision or local measurement noise is considered. The local scan geometry depends on the distance and the orientation of the scanned surface, relative to the position of the scanner. The local scan geometry is parameterized by two main parameters, the range, i.e. the distance from the object to the scanner and the incidence angle, i.e. the angle between incoming laser beam and the local surface normal. In this paper, it is shown that by studying the influence of the local scan geometry on the signal to noise ratio, the dependence of the measurement noise on range and incidence angle can be successfully modeled if planar surfaces are observed. The implications of this model is demonstrated further by comparing two point clouds of a small room, obtained from two different scanner positions: a center position and a corner position. The influence of incidence angle on the noise level is quantified on scans of this room, and by moving the scanner by 2 m, it is reduced by 20%. The improvement of the standard deviation is significant, going from 3.23 to 2.55 mm. It is possible to optimize measurement setups in such a way that the measurement noise due to bad scanning geometry is minimized and therefore contribute to a more efficient acquisition of point clouds of better quality.},

Where aeolian processes are active, sedimentation patterns may rapidly change the soil moisture on a thin veneer of the surface that determines sediment entrainment. Here we present terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) as a promising method for detecting moisture at high temporal and spatial resolution within the range where aeolian transport is possible and illustrate its applicability using playa and beach case studies. TLS instruments are active sensors that record the return intensity (or backscatter) of a laser pulse. This signal intensity is influenced by both distance and surface properties. Calibration relationships are outlined that correct for both distance and moisture and explore the influence of grain size and mineralogy. We also show that by normalising intensity using a dry surface, the resulting relative ratio infers changes in moisture patterns and is a useful alternative when sediment calibrations are not available. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Dune growth and post-storm recovery of foredune systems is predominantly determined by the aeolian sand transport through the beach-dune interface. Potential sand transport rates, estimated with empirical transport equations using regionally representative wind conditions, are generally too high. This positive bias might be, at least partly, due to the effect of the beach and foredune topography on the regional airflow. Here, we investigate the relation between local (on the beach) and regional wind velocities and direction in front of the high (~22 m) and steep (~1:2.5) foredune partially vegetated with Marram grass at Egmond aan Zee, The Netherlands based on a dataset with a large variety in wind speeds spanning over all onshore wind directions. We observed that local 10-minute averaged wind speed and direction can differ from the regional wind conditions (here measured 15 km away from the study site) depending on the regional approach angle of the wind. The ratio of local over regional wind speed is smallest (~0.39) when the wind direction is dune-normal. This ratio increases with increasing obliquity towards almost 1 for alongshore winds. Wind steering only happens at the dune foot and is the largest (~13o) with oblique approaching winds of 40o from the dune normal. Perpendicular and nearly alongshore winds do not show any steering near the dune foot. The use of local rather than regional wind conditions in a potential transport equation reduces the predicted annual supply from 86 to 32 m3/m/y, substantially closer to the measured deposition of 15 m3/m/y. The drop in velocity was more important to the reduction in predicted supply than the alongshore steering.},

   abstract = {Evidence from a field study on wind flow and sediment transport across a beach-dune system under onshore and offshore conditions (including oblique approach angles) indicates that sediment transport response on the back-beach and stoss slope of the foredune can be exceedingly complex. The upper-air flow - measured by a sonic anemometer at the top of a 3·5m tower located on the dune crest - is similar to regional wind records obtained from a nearby meteorological station, but quite different from the near-surface flow field measured locally across the beach-dune profile by sonic anemometers positioned 20cm above the sand surface. Flow-form interaction at macro and micro scales leads to strong modulation of the near-surface wind vectors, including wind speed reductions (due to surface roughness drag and adverse pressure effects induced by the dune) and wind speed increases (due to flow compression toward the top of the dune) as well as pronounced topographic steering during oblique wind approach angles. A conceptual model is proposed, building on the ideas of Sweet and Kocurek (Sedimentology 37: 1023-1038, 1990), Walker and Nickling (Earth Surface Processes and Landforms 28: 111-1124, 2002), and Lynch et al. (Earth Surface Processes and Landforms 33: 991-1005, 2008, Geomorphology 105: 139-146, 2010), which shows how near-surface wind vectors are altered for four regional wind conditions: (a) onshore, detached; (b) onshore-oblique, attached and deflected; (c) offshore, detached; and (d) offshore-oblique, attached and deflected. High-frequency measurements of sediment transport intensity during these different events demonstrate that predictions of sediment flux using standard equations driven by regional wind statistics would by unreliable and misleading. It is recommended that field studies routinely implement experimental designs that treat the near-surface wind field as comprising true vector quantities (with speed and direction) in order that a more robust linkage between the regional (upper air) wind field and the sediment transport response across the beach-dune profile be established. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

   abstract = {Grain size affects the rates of aeolian sediment transport on beaches. Sediment in coastal environments typically consists of multiple grain-size fractions and exhibits spatiotemporal variations. Still, conceptual and numerical aeolian transport models are simplified and often only include a single fraction that is constant over the model domain. It is unclear to what extent this simplification is valid and if the inclusion of multi-fraction transport and spatial grain-size variations affects aeolian sediment transport simulations and predictions of coastal dune development. This study applies the numerical aeolian sediment transport model AeoLiS to compare single-fraction to multi-fraction approaches for a range of grain-size distributions and spatial grain-size scenarios. The results show that on timescales of days to years, single-fraction simulations with the median grain size, D50, often give similar results to multi-fraction simulations, provided the wind is able to mobilize all fractions within that time frame. On these timescales, vertical variability in grain size has a limited effect on total transport rates, but it does influence the simulation results on minute timescales. Horizontal grain-size variability influences both the total transport rates and the downwind bed grain-size composition. The results provide new insights into the influence of beach sediment composition and spatial variability on total transport rates toward the dunes. The findings of this study can guide the implementation of grain-size variability in numerical aeolian sediment transport models.},

   abstract = {Rapid urban development has been widespread in many arid regions of the world during the Anthropocene. Such development has the potential to affect, and be affected by, local and regional dunefield dynamics. While urban design often includes consideration of the wind regime, the potential impact of construction on the surrounding environment is seldom considered and remains poorly understood. In this study, regional airflow modeling during successive stages of urbanization at Maspalomas, Gran Canaria, Spain, indicates significant and progressive flow perturbations that have altered the adjacent dunefield. Significant modifications to the boundary layer velocity, mean wind directionality, turbulence intensity, and sediment flux potential are attributed to the extension of the evolving urban geometry into the internal boundary layer. Two distinct process/response zones were identified: (1) the urban shadow zone where widespread dune stabilization is attributed to the sheltering effect of the urban area on surface wind velocity; and (2) the acceleration zone where airflow is deflected away from the urbanized area, causing an increase in sediment transport potential and surface erosion. Consistent coherent turbulent structures were identified at landform and dunefield scales: counter-rotating vortices develop in the lee-side flow of dune crests and shedding off the buildings on the downwind edge of the urban area. This study illustrates the direct geomorphic impact of urbanization on aeolian dunefield dynamics, a relationship that has received little previous attention. The study provides a template for investigations of the potential impact of urbanization in arid zones.},

In this study, we investigated the suitability of a new remote sensing method to monitor the spatio-temporal variation in surface moisture on a sandy beach using a long-range static terrestrial laser scanner (TLS). The TLS was permanently deployed on top of a 42 m high building overlooking the study site at Ostend-Mariakerke, Belgium. Considering the effect of target surface roughness on the intensity and the laboratory's length limitation, a new intensity correction method is proposed which only uses the field point cloud data measured on a homogenous beach surface (without time-consuming indoor experiments). Based on the corrected intensity data, the relation of the beach surface moisture to the corrected intensity was modeled by an exponential model with a correlation-coefficient squared of 0.92. A moisture estimation model was developed which can directly derive the beach surface moisture from the original intensity data of the TLS with a standard error of 2.27%. The hourly surface moisture dynamics across two tidal cycles on the beach were investigated as a case study, in which the point clouds derived from corresponding unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery are utilized to improve the calculation accuracy of the incidence angles of TLS point clouds at long distances. Results reveal that, after the intensity correction, the long-range static TLS is an extremely suitable technique to monitor the surface moisture dynamics (daytime and nighttime) over a substantial beach section (hundreds of meters) at a high scanning frequency (minutes to hours).},

   abstract = {[1] The superimposition of rhythmic bed forms of different spatial scales is a common and natural phenomenon on sandy seabeds. The dynamics of such seabeds may interfere with different offshore activities and are therefore of interest to both scientists and offshore developers. State-of-the-art echo sounding accuracy allows for the analysis of bed form dynamics on unprecedented spatial and temporal scales. However, the superimposition of bed forms complicates the automated determination of morphodynamic parameters of individual bed form components. In this research we present the extension and comparison of two well-known, automated signal-processing methods for the 1-D and 2-D separation of bathymetric data derived from multibeam echo soundings into different components that each represents a bed form of a particular length scale. One method uses geostatistical filtering, and the other uses a Fourier decomposition of the bathymetric data. The application of both methods in two case studies of the North Sea shows that both methods are successful and that results correspond well. For example, megaripples up to 0.83 m height could be separated from 1.49-2.28 m high sand waves, and regionally averaged lengths and heights of sand waves, as calculated in either method, differ only 0.42-8.2% between methods. The obtained sand wave migration rates differ 7-11% between methods. The resulting morphometric and morphodynamic bed form quantification contributes to studies of empirical behavior and morphodynamic model validation and is valuable in risk assessments of offshore human activities.

   abstract = {A beach in Mariakerke-Bad (Belgium) was monitored in 2017-2018 for more than a year with a near-continuous laser scan system. From a total of 8500 scans 7700 hourly scan epochs were used to study the spatio-temporal shoreward sand transport at the beach. In order to account for weather influences and other possible disturbances of the scan-system, a time-dependent correction method was applied to reduce rotation errors up to 0.2 degrees in the point cloud orientation (around the zero point of the laser scanner) reducing height errors on the beach to the order of centimeters. Cross shore analysis of the beach profile shows that shoreward transport occurs at most times during the year with an accumulated maximum of 17m3/m throughout the measurement period and maximum transport rates of 0.6 m3/m/day. However most of the shoreward sand transport is redistributed seawards again due to beach shaping leaving a total of about 2 m3/m a year which is below the average values found along the Belgium coast. The spatio-temporal behavior of the shoreward sand transport has been studied with the 4D-OBC analysis technique which identified accumulations of sand in the full 4D point cloud dataset. A total of about 3600 4D-OBC accumulation events were identified and most found accumulations on the beach can be associated with natural (aeolian) processes. Also, accumulations appear to occur during the whole year which is consistent with the previous cross-shore analysis.},

   abstract = {A global-scale calculation identifies peaks in a digital elevation model (DEM) and computes their isolation and topographic prominence. A new DEM is presented that covers the entire globe at 90 meter resolution with no substantial voids or artifacts. All peaks with at least 1 kilometer of isolation are found, and the closest higher ground is identified. For prominence, all peaks with at least *30 meters are found, and the key saddle is identified. The prominence algorithm uses results from Morse-Smale topology to run in parallel on standard, freely available elevation data. Thirteen previously unknown "ultra-prominent" mountains with at least 1500 meters of prominence are listed.},

   abstract = {Newest developments in laser scanner technologies put surveyors in the position to comply with the ever increasing demand of high-speed, high-accuracy, and highly reliable data acquisition from terrestrial, mobile, and airborne platforms. Echo digitization in pulsed time-of-flight laser ranging has demonstrated its superior performance in the field of bathymetry and airborne laser scanning for more than a decade, however at the cost of somewhat time consuming off line post processing. State-of-the-art online waveform processing as implemented in RIEGL’s V-Line not only saves users post-processing time to obtain true 3D point clouds, it also adds the assets of calibrated amplitude and reflectance measurement for data classification and pulse deviation determination for effective and reliable data validation. We present results from data acquisitions in different complex target situations.},

   abstract = {Aeolian dune development is influenced by feedback between surface properties and sedi-ment  transport,  yet  little  is  known  about  the  larger  scale  temporal  and  spatial  natures  of  this  relationship.  Surface  moisture  is  particularly  influential,  and  is  generally  recognized  in  aeolian environments for its ability to increase the critical shear velocity required to entrain sediment  in  beach  settings  or,  alternatively,  to  sustain  vegetation  and  stabilize  surfaces  at  a  dune-field scale. However, conceptual models and field work have alluded to its importance in protodune initiation, while field observations infer that seasonal moisture input may contribute to residual dune ridge formation at the dune-field scale. This has the potential to reveal geomorphic adaptation to variations in climate, and identify a recognizable signature in the rock  record.  This  article  presents  a  simulation  model  that  produces  geomorphological  features  similar  to  field  observations  and  is  capable  of  examining  the  implications  of  surface  and  transport  feedback  at  both  scales.  Results  (1)  reveal  the  control  of  surface  moisture  at  different temporal scales, (2) display complexity in the development of multiple spatial scales within a cellular automaton framework, (3) highlight the importance of transient sand strips and sediment supply frequency in aeolian transport dynamics and protodune development, and (4) explore the relationship and significance of feedback duration, development time, and bedform spatial scale in the development of incipient dunes. This study illustrates the importance of considering geomorphic feedback when assessing the influence of surface moisture in aeolian process–dominated systems.},

   abstract = {Multi-scale bathymetries observed in laboratory channels and natural rivers have posed several challenges to the description of bedform geometry and kinematics. To better quantify scale-dependent migration velocity, high resolution spatio-temporal bed evolution data are analyzed using three independent methods: (i) a bedform tracking method that identifies individual bedforms in longitudinal bed elevation profiles, (ii) a cross-correlation based, image matching technique in consecutive bathymetry scans similar to Particle Image Velocimetry, and (iii) two-dimensional frequency-wavenumber spectra marking a dispersion relation between bedform period and length, allowing estimation of Fourier-based, scale-dependent migration velocities. The comparative studies show that the spectral and bedform tracking methods present small differences in the migration velocity of medium-large bedforms. However, significant deviations occur in the small bedforms, mostly due to bedform sheltering or amplified exposure to the flow, which also contribute to their enhanced scale-dependent deformation. The analysis also shows that some form of scale separation is needed to extract the large and slowly migrating bedforms as they are masked by secondary features when several bedform orders coexist. Bathymetric Image Velocimetry reasonably estimates the averaged migration velocity and exhibits potential to study relations between spanwise bed surface velocity and local bedform kinematics.},
